# WordPress Admin Notices

WordPress admin notices provide a convenient way to display messages to users in the admin area, e.g. after a post has been updated or a plugin has been activated. They're also used by many themes and plugins to display notifications about anything from new features or security warnings to details about ongoing promotions or upgrade prompts.

WordPress core provides four different admin notices which can be used contextually to alert a user to a specific type of notice. This is achieved by displaying a unique accent color for each type of admin notice.

Admin notices are usually displayed at the top of every admin page to stand out from the main page content and be clearly noticeable. They are elegantly designed so as to not be too visually distracting.
